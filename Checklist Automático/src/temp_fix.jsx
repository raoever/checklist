// Temporary script to fix the SELECT issue by using "NONE" instead of empty string
const content = `
// All SelectItem with value="" should be changed to value="NONE"
// All onValueChange with '' should include 'NONE'
// All status checks for '' should be changed to 'NONE' 
`;

// The issue is that Radix UI doesn't allow empty string values in SelectItem
// So we need to use "NONE" instead of empty string for the "not verified" state
